Script used to automatically screen out contestants who have submitted beatmaps with too many infractions. The script will parse through all the `.osz` files included in an input named `input` in the same directory as the script, and output the results in the console.

This repository also includes a log of all the entries at the time of being checked by the script, including the amount of infractions they had.

## Requirements

For this script to function, you must have [Reamber Py](https://pypi.org/project/reamber/) and its dependencies installed.
